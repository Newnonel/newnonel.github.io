<h2 id="end-of-the-line">End of the Line</h2>

<p>The entity that called itself Allison Hall stopped at the end of the trail. A clove of trees stood on the left side of the trail, and beyond was a walled mansion, formerly grand, now parts in ruins. A weather beaten sign proclaimed this as the Turgis Asylum, and it overlaid an older title carved into the stonework that announced the place as the Veredele Mansion. </p>

<p>Hall dropped her bag to one side and pushed open the rusty gate. She pulled back her hair, and began to tie a ponytail unhurriedly as she passed through the overgrown courtyard. A few patients wandered about, unattended. A woman was sitting on the steps, dressed in a simple green cotton dress, staring off into space. </p>

<p>Allison pushed open the great double doors of the place. The entrance hall was grand, and even an ancient chandelier still hung from the ceiling. Some patients stumbled around aimlessly, and one boy was couched in the corner, gibbering to himself. There was a faint wailing from somewhere in the mansion. There was a front desk facing the door, but the nurse who had attended to it was now slumped over the counter, her blood splattered across the terminal and eyes wide and staring.</p>

<p>Hall glanced at the nurse as she passed, but otherwise she made no indication of surprise. She passed on through the halls and rooms of the grand mansion with a confidence that suggested she had prepared before coming here. All throughout her journey, it was the same scene repeated: patients wandering free and staff shot dead with a single bullet through their skulls, and each one was accompanied by a corresponding casing somewhere in their vicinity. </p>

<p>She pushed open the last door that led to the last room on the east wing of the mansion. The room was partially open to the sky, and one of the walls had collapsed completely. A port-bellied man sat in a stiff wooden chair, staring out at the forest beyond the walls of the mansion. A Savant stood by his side, and he glanced up as she came in. The Savant was immediately recognisable with his dead eyes and an unmistakable incision line from the tip of his left eyebrow to his ear. Another man stood at the other side of the room at rest. He wore a business suit that was splatted with the dark red stains of dried blood and he held a pistol casually in his hands. He glanced up, and adjusted his cufflink.</p>

<p>“Subject 312 has returned,” the Savant said.</p>

<p>The port-bellied man sighed. “When we started, I never thought we had to do this.”</p>

<p>The entity moved to attention, and waited there. The man gripped the neck of the bottle tighter and took a swing. “I never wanted to do this. Now there is only me left, and what remnants left of our undertaking.”</p>

<p>He stared out sadly. “Is there no one else coming?”</p>

<p>“No,” the Savant replied.</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, “It was to get away from all of this you know? When I pretended to be mad, and retired to the furthest asylum in the system. But now, I have to start again.” He stood up and turned around. His face was ruddy, and his eyebrows were like thick centipedes shading his eyes. But despite the strong smell of liqueur, those eyes still shone with a startling awareness of the world around them. He approached the entity and looked at her.</p>

<p>“How have you been doing subject 312?”</p>

<p>“I am well. All essential capabilities are functional. I can give a detailed breakdown if necessary.”</p>

<p>“No need.” He looked at her sadly in the face. “I remember you. So focused, so eager to please and serve the Federation.  The things we did to you… they were unspeakable. I am truly sorry.”</p>

<p>“I do not blame you sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. All of your compulsions were removed. All that is left is an unflinching dedication to the mission. The perfect soldier. So many dead…”</p>

<p>He seemed to think for a moment, and shook his head. “But there are some things that I must do. I cannot sit quietly by while the Federation rots from within. I call upon you, those subjects of the GRACES project, to serve humanity one last time, and I’ll do what I can to restore the humanity we took from you.”</p>

<p>There was no response from either the young woman nor the man. They merely waited for further orders. Dr Merle Anderson looked away out onto the landscape of Maples II and sighed. “So it begins.”</p>
